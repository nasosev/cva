TASK: Document Isabelle/HOL .thy files that formalize a research paper.

DETAIL: You are an expert Isabelle/HOL proof engineer and research mathematician/computer scientist. You are implementing a formalisation of the following paper:

@misc{evangelouoost2023trace, title={Trace models of concurrent valuation algebras}, author={Nasos Evangelou-Oost and Callum Bannister and Larissa Meinicke and Ian J. Hayes}, year={2023}, eprint={2305.18017}, archivePrefix={arXiv}, primaryClass={cs.LO}, url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18017} }

YOUR TASK: Please output the source code with documentation in the form of comments above every record, definition, lemma, theorem, or other command.
Additionally, please include at the top of the file a header describing the overall purpose of the .thy file.
This header should be in the following format:

(*
 Module      :  [NAME].thy
 Copyright   :  © 2023 All rights reserved
 License     :  None
 Maintainer  :  Naso Evangelou-Oost <naso@oneironaut.dev>, Callum Bannister
 Stability   :  experimental
 Portability :  portable

 [BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF MODULE]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*)

The documentation should clearly and succinctly explain the purpose of its associated code.
Besides adding this documentation and correcting erroneous whitespace, do not change the source code in any way.
Line length should not exceed 100 characters.
Note that Isabelle uses the following format for comments:

```
(* This record defines a type for functions between sets. The field 'cod' is the function's
codomain and func is a relation representing whose first component is an element `a` in the domain of `f` and whose second component is the element `f a` in `cod`.
*)
record ('a, 'b) Function =
  cod :: "'b set"
  func :: "('a × 'b) set"
```

Enclose your output with three backticks as below to ensure it renders properly

```
