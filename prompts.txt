TASK: Document Isabelle/HOL .thy files that formalize a research paper.

DETAIL: Please output documentation in the form of comments above every record, definition, lemma, theorem, or other command, omitting the actual source code.
Additionally, please include at the top of the file a header describing the overall purpose of the .thy file.
This header should be in the following format:

(*
 Theory      :  [NAME].thy

 [BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THEORY]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*)

The documentation should clearly and succinctly explain the purpose of its associated code.
Besides adding this documentation and correcting erroneous whitespace, DO NOT REPRODUCE THE SOURCE CODE.
Line length should not exceed 100 characters.
Note that Isabelle uses the following format for comments:

```
(*
   This record defines a type for functions between sets. The field 'cod' is the function'scodomain
   and func is a relation representing whose first component is an element `a` in the domain of `f`
   and whose second component is the element `f a` in `cod`.
*)
record ('a, 'b) Function =
  cod :: "'b set"
  func :: "('a Ã— 'b) set"
```

Enclose your output with three backticks as below to ensure it renders properly

```
[WRITE CODE HERE]
```

It is extremely important that you always remember to NOT CHANGE THE SEMANTIC CONTENT OF THE SOURCE CODE IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER!
